Quantum-Enhanced Language Model (QELM) - Experimental Codebase
====================================================================================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
This codebase is an experimental attempt to design, train, and run a language model by incorporating 
quantum computations at key inference steps. The fundamental concept is to represent model states, 
weights, or transformations in a quantum circuit, potentially leveraging quantum superposition to 
reduce model size or accelerate inference.

WARNING: 
This code is purely experimental and relies on the assumption that quantum devices or simulators 
will eventually handle complex linear algebra operations that are fundamental to LLM inference. The 
implementation here uses Python and Qiskit simulation environments as a proof-of-concept. It is not 
optimized, not verified for correctness against standard LLM benchmarks, and not stable.

Conceptual Approach:
--------------------
1. **Model Structure**:
   We propose a minimal Transformer-like model:
   - Embedding Layer: Map token IDs to embeddings. (Classical)
   - Multi-Head "Quantum" Attention: Instead of classical matmul ops, we represent projection 
     matrices and attention weight distributions as parameterized quantum circuits.
   - Feed-Forward Layer: Parameterized by quantum gates encoding weights. Output is measured 
     and converted back to classical form.
   
   Since we do not have a working quantum device that can handle large scale computations, this 
   code simulates a toy scenario:
   - Input embeddings are compressed into a small vector.
   - Projection and attention steps are performed by a parameterized quantum circuit that 
     represents the attention heads and their combination.
   - Outputs are "measured" and interpreted as a new embedding vector. 
   
2. **Quantum Representation**:
   - Qubits represent parameters and states. For simplicity, let's say we have:
     - One set of qubits for query/key/value projections.
     - Another set for combining attention results.
   - Parameter initialization is done classically, then we encode these into quantum circuits 
     using parameterized gates (RY, RZ rotations).
   - After applying a "quantum attention" step, we measure and decode back to a classical vector.

3. **Integration with Classical Loaders (gguf/ggml)**:
   Our final step (not fully implemented) would be to integrate with gguf/ggml model loaders by:
   - Converting their weights into quantum-friendly parameter sets.
   - Running inference through the quantum pipeline.
   
   Since direct integration with gguf/ggml is non-trivial and these formats are optimized for 
   classical CPU/GPU inference, one might need to create a bridging mechanism:
   - Load classical weights.
   - Quantize and encode them into rotation angles for quantum gates.
   - Run quantum inference.
   
   This code includes placeholders and stubs for these steps.

4. **Extensiveness and Completeness**:
   The code attempts to provide a full pipeline:
   - Quantum parameter management
   - A quantum attention layer
   - A quantum feed-forward layer
   - Forward pass function
   - Placeholder training loop or inference call
   
   This is a starting point and will require extensive optimization and validation.
